# MEGACALCULATER

In this project, a calculator that can perform simple operations with whole and decimal numbers was created using HTML.

### Our calculator does not have below feature:
- It does not have operator precedence, so when we use more than one operator in calculation process, it can give wrong answer.
- It does not have deletion button, so we cannot do deletion operation and because of that we have to reset all our display panel to do correct operation.
